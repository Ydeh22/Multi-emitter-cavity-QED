# Photon transport through multi-emitter cavity QED systems with S-Matrix.

Implementation of the scattering matrix approach described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03942 for simulating multi-emitter cavity QED systems. The functions for computing single- and two-photon scattering matrix calculation can be found in `single_photon_transport.py` and `two_photon_transport.py`. Refer to documentation in the code for more details.
